# Low-Signal PR Triage

Use this policy only when the job explicitly asks for manual backlog cleanup,
low-signal PR triage, or garbage PR review. It is not the default dedupe policy.

Close only when the PR is open, live state was re-fetched, and the evidence is
boringly clear. Prefer `needs_human` for anything with a plausible current bug,
owner discussion, green checks, or a focused fix that should be preserved.

## Strong close signals

- Blank or mostly untouched PR template: placeholder lines such as
  `Problem:`, `Why it matters:`, or `Describe the problem and fix` remain empty,
  and the title/files do not supply a concrete OpenClaw problem.
- Random docs-only change: root README translations, generic wording tweaks,
  drive-by guide additions, or community-plugin discoverability docs that should
  be handled through ClawHub instead.
- Low-signal test-only change: broad coverage additions, snapshot churn, or
  tests for trivial helpers without a linked bug, maintainer request, or product
  change in the same PR.
- Churn/refactor-only change: variable renames, formatting, generated/baseline
  edits, or "cleanup" without a requested fix.
- Third-party capability in core: new channel, provider, skill, tool, or plugin
  surface that should be published and maintained externally on ClawHub.
- Risky ops/infra drive-by: new external CI service, release workflow, Docker
  base migration, host upgrade script, apt retry/fix-missing tweak, or service
  manager behavior without owner request and green validation.
- Dirty branch: stated change is narrow, but files include unrelated docs,
  generated baselines, other extensions, runtime surfaces, or review artifacts.
- Bot/review spam: repeated bot pings or copied bot output without author-owned
  fixes, especially when checks are still red.

## Evidence bar

Do not close for red CI alone. Combine red/stale state with at least one strong
low-signal category above, or leave it for a human.

Use these checks before recommending close:

- PR is open in live GitHub state.
- `target_updated_at` is recorded.
- Action is `close_low_signal` with `classification: "low_signal"`.
- `target_kind` is `pull_request`.
- `canonical`, `duplicate_of`, and `candidate_fix` are `null`; low-signal cleanup is not dedupe.
- The latest author activity does not show an active fix in progress.
- No maintainer has approved, assigned, or requested the work.
- The close comment preserves a reopen path.

## Comment shapes

Blank template:

```md
Thanks for the contribution. I am closing this because the PR title/body do not
explain a concrete OpenClaw problem or reviewable fix, and the template is
effectively blank. Please reopen from a clean branch with a scoped summary,
linked issue or rationale, and validation if this is still needed.
```

Random docs / ClawHub:

```md
Thanks for the contribution. I am closing this because this is a low-signal
docs-only discoverability change. Community skills and plugins should be
published on ClawHub instead of added to the core repo/docs queue.
```

Low-signal tests:

```md
Thanks for the contribution. I am closing this because it is test-only coverage
without a linked bug, owner request, or behavior change, and it is stale/red.
We are keeping the queue focused on fixes with clear product value and current
validation.
```

Dirty branch:

```md
Thanks for the contribution. I am closing this because the branch appears dirty:
the stated change is narrow, but the diff includes unrelated files. Please
recreate the PR from current main with one scoped change.
```

Risky infra:

```md
Thanks for the contribution. I am closing this because it changes repo
infrastructure/operations without owner approval and current green validation.
Please open an issue or maintainer-approved design first if this is still
needed.
```

## Never close under this policy

- Security reports or security-sensitive code that should go through the
  security triage path.
- A green PR with a focused bug fix and clear reproduction.
- A PR with recent maintainer review, assignment, or active author follow-up.
- A unique bug report with reproduction detail, even if noisy.
- Anything that would require technical judgment about correctness beyond the
  low-signal category.
